If you still have issues, let us know through an email at team@craiyon.com or reach out on Discord and we'll look into it.`},
{"id":9,"title": "How does the AI model work?", "description": `The model learns concepts from images. Each time you enter a prompt, it will create unique images based on its current knowledge and will try to combine the concepts from your prompt in a creative way. You can find more details about our first model in our W&B Project Report or the DALL¬∑E mini model card.
`},
{"id":10,"title": "Are there biases or limitations in AI generated art?", "description": `Yes, seeing as it learns through existing images, it is exposed to societal prejudices and harmful stereotypes so can integrate these into its images.
